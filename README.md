# Task 07 – Stakeholder Decision Report

## 📌 Overview

This project delivers a **stakeholder-focused decision report** for Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse (2024 season). The report translates raw statistics and AI-assisted analyses from earlier tasks into **risk-tiered recommendations** for coaches, staff, and administrators.

It integrates findings from:

* **Task 04 – Descriptive Statistics** (pipelines, validation, summary metrics)
* **Task 05 – Q&A and Visuals** (verified outputs, charts, audience insights)
* **Task 06 – Synthetic Interview** (AI-generated perspectives, ethical labeling)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this report is to provide Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse staff with **clear, risk-tiered recommendations** to strengthen 2024 performance, based on official game statistics, prior AI-driven analysis, coding verification, and a transparent review process.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

* **Performance:** 22 games, 16–3–3 record, 335 goals for, 248 goals against.
* **Players:** Tyrrell led with 70 goals, Goodale with 47 draw controls.
* **Risks:** High turnover margin (317 vs 334), heavy reliance on starters (82% of goals).
* **Fan Engagement:** Attendance peaked late in the season, with variability linked to opponent rank and timing.

---

## 🛠️ Methods

* Pipelines (Python, Pandas, Polars) to validate descriptive stats.
* Q&A framework to answer stakeholder-oriented questions.
* Visualizations:

  * Figure 1. Attendance Trend
  * Figure 2. Goals For vs Goals Against
  * Figure 3. Top Scorers
  * Figure 4. Goals by Quarter
* Synthetic interview (Task_06) with transparency on AI involvement.

## ⚖️ Uncertainty & Fairness

* Results are **descriptive, not causal**.
* Planned robustness checks: bootstrap estimates, opponent-adjusted stats.
* Starters contributed **82% of goals**, bench **18%**, highlighting reliance on core players.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* **Low Risk:** Emphasize turnover drills, improve ball security.
* **Medium Risk:** Adjust practice workloads, expand bench minutes.
* **High Risk:** Consider lineup/strategy changes only after validation.

---

## 📌 Ethics & Transparency

* All synthetic content is **clearly labeled**.
* Data is from official, public sources.
* Code and analysis pipelines are openly documented for reproducibility.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Pilot turnover and bench-rotation adjustments.
* Track metrics mid-season.
* Issue a mid-season memo with updated recommendations.
